What works now:
- Most of the charactersheet can auto calc values aside from Saves and Rank bonus
- Click on the skill/attribute and it should roll 1d100+ value. There is a RollMod field that you should adjust for plus/minus.

What doesn't yet work:

- No NPC sheet
- Open ended rolls.

<Sheet is currently completely broken>
