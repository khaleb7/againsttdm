This is quite literally 'boilerplate' at the moment.

Most of the character data is complete, the extremely basic charactersheet is underway.

The goals for version .01:
- Data model for character
- Data model for NPC
- Macro for Die Roller

Not usable at the moment, but anyone who has some changes/additions (or knows HTML/CSS beyond what happened in 1998...) please 
PR away!
